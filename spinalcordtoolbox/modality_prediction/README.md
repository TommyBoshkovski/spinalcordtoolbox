This folders contains the implementation of the automatic modality classifier. To repo for the training of the model can be found [here](https://github.com/bsauty/sc_mri_modality_detection).


# TODO

- [ ] Document code and cleanup according to PEP8 standard, including the training repo
- [ ] Test PyTorch integration in SCT 
- [ ] Add dwi contrast
- [ ] Test on `sct_testing_large`
- [ ] Upload the model on [OSF](https://osf.io/jyp2z/) and [wiki](https://www.neuro.polymtl.ca)

And add automatic contrast detection for :
- [ ] sct_label_vertebrae
- [ ] sct_detect_pmj
- [ ] sct_deepseg_sc
- [ ] sct_get_centerline (with optic)
- [ ] sct_propseg
- [ ] sct_deepseg_lesion
- [ ] sct_registration_to_template
